# RETIREMENT

Unfortunatly I cannot keep supporting this application and due to the lack of time it is being retired. 

No more work will be donne to it and some day we might delete this repository.

# Table of Contents

The CCM System helps you manage credentials and configurations filtering access to sepecific servers and environments. 

This is the first public release and there is still a lot of working and translation to be done. 


The current version is 1.5. This version is the LAST version using php and is going to be replaced with a new version soon.
